# Neural Networks from Scratch

Neural Networks from Scratch implemented in Python with NumPy.

## Introduction

There is great value in building things from scratch, and I have been inspired to build neural networks from the ground up to better understand how they work. 

My code would not exist without the great [NNFS Book](https://nnfs.io/), which I encourage you to read if you'd like to learn more about this fascinating subject.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Mamba Package Manager

I use the [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package manager for Python. You can install it on your machine (if not installed already) prior to running any code from this repository.

### Step 2: Setting up your Environment

Next, you'll want to create an environment with Mamba for running your Python code. I've provided the commands for doing this below:

```bash
mamba create -n nnfs python=3.10
mamba activate nnfs
mamba install numpy matplotlib
pip install nnfs
```

You can find all code in the `src` directory.

## Notes

- This is an in-progress repository! I plan to finish this by the end of March 2024. Stay tuned!
- I *may* also implement Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks from Scratch in the future
