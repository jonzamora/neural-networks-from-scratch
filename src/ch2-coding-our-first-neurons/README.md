# Chapter 2 - Coding our First Neurons

## Structure

I've split the contents of this chapter into 3 chunks:

1. `math` -- this contains some simple vector math operations in vanilla Python and with NumPy
2. `vanilla_python` -- this contains implementations of a single neuron and single layer of a fully-connected neural network in _vanilla Python_
3. `numpy` -- this contains implementations of a single neuron and single layer of a fully-connected neural network with _NumPy_
